## PLAN (Please write your plan or correct me where ever it seems neccesary):
2d- Platform game with different levels (lets say 3 for now). Increasing difficulty. Can add a lore to the game connecting each level story wise. A simple machanic oriented game like invert gravity by pressing a button and charecter now flips and has to clear the level with puzzle like challenges that are related to making decisions about when to invert gravity to go ahead. There can be more mechanics like longer you press a key the longer you jump upto some max limit. There can be powerups or tools distributed across the level to boost the player like longer jump limit, or faster speed, or even give negative effects, like temporary restriction to gravity invert or jump. 


Sooo, here is the proper description for the above concept. Let me know how it looks.

### Description:
Gravity flip is a 2d platform game where players use the ability to invert gravity to navigative through progreassively challenging levels. The game will have 10 levels, combining puzzles, decision-making, and timing. The story connects each level, giving a sense of propression as the player moves to next levels.

### Game Mechanics:

Move charecter with A and D. A to go left, D to go right. Space bar to jump.

Press button (maybe UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT keys to show the direction of gravity?) to change gravity, charecter will now get upside down and walk on celings and walls. Timing is key to get through the obstacles as there will be strategically placed to requiere some thought and timing. Holding space for longer gives a longer jump, so that is also crutial to dtermine how long to hold space for.

Power-ups and Tools:

Positive Effects:
-Longer jump limit.
-Increased movement speed.

Negative Effects:
-Temporary restriction on gravity inversion.
-Reduced jump height or speed.

## Level Design:

Progression:
Levels become harder as you advance, introducing new challenges like moving platforms, timed obstacles, and tricky puzzles.

Power-up Placement:
Strategic placement of power-ups encourages exploration and adds complexity to decision-making.

Negative Effects:
Negative power-ups introduce risk and require careful planning to avoid.


### Game lore:

You guys are welcome to suggest yours, but this is what I has thought. 

Introduction:
You wake up in a strange and broken world, where gravity pulls in unnatural directions. 
Pieces of land float in the air, and a mysterious voice whispers:
"Restore balance, or all will be lost."
With no memory of how you got here, you set out to discover the truth, using your unique 
ability to flip gravity to navigate the dangers of this shattered dimension.

The Journey Across 10 Levels
Level 1: The Awakening
You find yourself in "The Fragmented Plains," surrounded by pieces of land floating in a 
void. Strange markings on the walls give you simple instructions: "Flip gravity to 
survive." As you start to navigate, you realize that this place was once whole, but 
something has torn it apart.

Level 2: The Broken Path
"The Shattered Pathway" is filled with gaps and crumbling platforms. You start to notice 
warnings etched into the rocks: "You are not the first to try." The broken pieces of 
this world feel like they’re watching you as you carefully learn to time your gravity 
flips to survive.

Level 3: Echoes of the Past
In "The Echoing Caverns," faint voices fill the air, like ghosts trapped in time. They 
say things like, "We failed... don’t make the same mistake." The puzzles become more 
complex, requiring precise jumps as you start to sense that this world wasn’t always 
this way—it was broken by something, or someone.

Level 4: The Gravity Core
"The Gravity Core" is a glowing structure pulsing with energy, causing platforms and 
hazards to shift. The air feels unstable, and the carvings here warn: "The core is 
unstable. Do not linger." You’re forced to think quickly as moving platforms and 
collapsing paths test your mastery of gravity flipping.

Level 5: The Forgotten Ruins
You reach "The Forgotten Ruins," a crumbling, overgrown temple. Strange glowing 
artifacts offer power, but some are cursed. Picking up the wrong one might limit your 
ability to flip gravity or jump, forcing you to plan carefully. Another voice whispers: 
"Sacrifices were made here to maintain balance."

Level 6: The Inverted Temple
Gravity feels twisted and disorienting in "The Inverted Temple." The walls seem to 
shift, and platforms disappear without warning. Ancient symbols show a civilization that 
once controlled gravity, but their experiments clearly went wrong. You begin to suspect 
that you’re part of the same experiment.

Level 7: The Void’s Edge
"The Void’s Edge" is the most chaotic place you’ve seen yet. The land crumbles behind 
you as you run, and speed power-ups help you escape in time. The voice returns, louder 
now: "You’re close. The balance resists your interference." You start to feel like 
something is watching, or even fighting against you.

Level 8: The Fractured Nexus
"The Fractured Nexus" is a maze of paths, each with hidden clues about the world’s past. 
You find fragments of a story: "We built the machine to control gravity... but we were 
wrong to think we could tame it." You realize that this machine, whatever it is, caused 
the destruction, and fixing it is the only way out.

Level 9: The Chaos Engine
The heart of the destruction, "The Chaos Engine," hums with unstable energy. The air is 
thick, and traps are everywhere. You finally see the machine, a massive structure 
spinning wildly, tearing the world apart. The voice warns: "If you don’t fix this, the 
world will collapse... but fixing it comes at a price."

Level 10: The Final Trial
You step into "The Balance Rift," where the machine is barely holding the world 
together. Every skill you’ve learned is tested here. The gravity flips faster, platforms 
collapse, and enemies block your way. The voice reveals the final truth: "The machine 
needs someone to stay and stabilize it. Will you make that choice?"

You must decide:

Sacrifice yourself to restore balance, leaving the world whole but trapping yourself 
forever.
Escape and let the world collapse, saving yourself but dooming everything else.
