PLAN (Please write your plan or correct me where ever it seems neccesary):
2d- Platform game with different levels (lets say 10 for now). Increasing difficulty. Can add a lore to the game connecting each level story wise. A simple machanic oriented game like invert gravity by pressing a button and charecter now flips and has to clear the level with puzzle like challenges that are related to making decisions about when to invert gravity to go ahead. There can be more mechanics like longer you press a key the longer you jump upto some max limit. There can be powerups or tools distributed across the level to boost the player like longer jump limit, or faster speed, or even give negative effects, like temporary restriction to gravity invert or jump. 


Sooo, here is the proper description for the above concept. Let me know how it looks.

Description:
Gravity flip is a 2d platform game where players use the ability to invert gravity to navigative through progreassively challenging levels. The game will have 10 levels, combining puzzles, decision-making, and timing. The story connects each level, giving a sense of propression as the player moves to next levels.

Game Mechanics:

Move charecter with A and D. A to go left, D to go right. Space bar to jump.

Press button (maybe UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT keys to show the direction of gravity?) to change gravity, charecter will now get upside down and walk on celings and walls. Timing is key to get through the obstacles as there will be strategically placed to requiere some thought and timing. Holding space for longer gives a longer jump, so that is also crutial to dtermine how long to hold space for.

Power-ups and Tools:

Positive Effects:
-Longer jump limit.
-Increased movement speed.

Negative Effects:
-Temporary restriction on gravity inversion.
-Reduced jump height or speed.

Level Design:

Progression:
Levels become harder as you advance, introducing new challenges like moving platforms, timed obstacles, and tricky puzzles.

Power-up Placement:
Strategic placement of power-ups encourages exploration and adds complexity to decision-making.

Negative Effects:
Negative power-ups introduce risk and require careful planning to avoid.
