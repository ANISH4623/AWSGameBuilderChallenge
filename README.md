PLAN (Please write your plan or correct me where ever it seems neccesary):
2d- Platform game with different levels (lets say 10 for now). Increasing difficulty. Can add a lore to the game connecting each level story wise. A simple machanic oriented game like invert gravity by pressing a button and charecter now flips and has to clear the level with puzzle like challenges that are related to making decisions about when to invert gravity to go ahead. There can be more mechanics like longer you press a key the longer you jump upto some max limit. There can be powerups or tools distributed across the level to boost the player like longer jump limit, or faster speed, or even give negative effects, like temporary restriction to gravity invert or jump.
